I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow.<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space!

I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. My caregivers have been keeping me busy by feeding me with a maze feeder and offering me a lot of chew toys! Due to my high energy I would thrive best in a home without younger children.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>I'm a Playgroup Pal! Ask the staff today about my interactions with other dogs at the shelter in our Playgroups.<p/><p/>I am a sweet gal who is still working on her leash skills :)<p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>I am a puppy!! I will need to find a home where someone is available for me in these early days. It is important to be consistent with me and socialize me so I can have the best companionship with people and other animals. Puppies require patience because everything is brand new so I will need some TLC while I learn. I am not potty trained or crate training yet and teaching me those skills will help tremendously on a road to success! If you and your family are ready to fall in love my awesome self, please check me out!!<p/><p/>I am a sweet pup who will need extra time and attention to warm up to new situations and new people. When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/>",

My name is Geno and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I weigh 55.0 lbs and am considered a ""large breed"" dog.<p/><p/>I have been in a wonderful foster home while I await for my forever family. My foster says this: Geno, is a cheerful, playful pup who wants nothing more than someone he can devote himself to. He is smart and wants to please. He loves all humans.  He has great house manners and is very food-motivated, which helps with training. Although he is anxious around other dogs, he has made much progress since being in a calm home environment. If you can bring some patience, kindness, and treats, you will be rewarded with a loving companion for life.<p/> <p/>I am motivated by many things like toys, treats and people! I will happily ""sit"" and ""shake"" for all of them :)<p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

My name is Clementine and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought to RASKC on May 24, 2025 then ultimately surrendered to RASKC.<p/><p/>When I arrived at RASKC I was in poor condition and injured. After a lot of extra TLC from my caregivers and the wonderful vet staff I am now on the mend. <p/><p/>I weigh 46.0 lbs and am considered a ""medium breed"" dog.<p/><p/>I am very treat motivated and working on how to ""sit"" for them.<p/><p/>I can be weary of strangers, but once I get to know you I just want to lay in your lap and get all the cuddles! <p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home without younger children (fast movements and loud noises startle me).<p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow. <p/><p/>",

I love a good snack, however, and that is the fastest way to my heart! Once I start to warm up to you, I get really cute and silly; I start to rub up on you like a kitty cat. That is how I show I am ready for your full love and attention.<p/><p/>Please go slow with me, and take your time to get to know me. I might take some time to warm up and adjust, so I am looking for a chill family with shy pitty experience.<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/><p/>Your new pet received a basic physical exam, in addition to routine vaccines, deworming, and topical flea preventative, if indicated.  Although your new pet is ready for adoption, there is always a possibility of additional medical conditions that have not been detected or may develop in the future.  Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1) Joint issues and mild left hip dysplasia - this patient has degenerative changes to both knees likely a result of CCL (cranial cruciate ligament) rupture or tears and left hip dysplasia. She has some pain/discomfort associated with this. We have started her on a joint supplement and pain medication that she may need to be on for life. Please monitor her and follow up with your regular vet for further management and treatment options.<p/><p/>Additional care for these conditions may be needed after adoption. Please follow up with your regular veterinarian.<p/><p/>",

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise.

I have been around children but seem to prefer adults - I have a very low-key personality and like to spend my time lounging instead of playing. I am most likely to succeed in a teen/adult home with a low energy level. My previous owners said I am both house trained and crate trained, though my new family should be prepared to provide a little refresher training when I come home. <p/><p/>I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/>",

My name is Opal! I was surrendered to RASKC by my previous owner when they could no longer care for me. <p/><p/>I'm a large but shy girl who takes time to warm up and would do best in a quiet, patient home. I startle easily at loud noises and can get scared of new people and experiences. My previous owner said I'm not a big fan of other dogs or cats and would probably like to be in a home by myself. I'll need someone who can be available to me to help me build my confidence! I may do best in a teen/adult home with people who understand I need time to decompress and adjust. <p/><p/>I am a large breed dog. I weigh 105lbs. <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

Due to this fact I would do best in a home without younger children.<p/><p/>My caregivers quickly learned that I can scale fences so I will need to be on leash at all times when on walks or taken out for potty-break.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",
